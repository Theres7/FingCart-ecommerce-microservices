# FingCart - E-commerce Application using Spring Boot + Spring Security + JWT + Microservices

FingCart is a microservices-based e-commerce platform developed with Spring Boot, Spring Security, and JWT.
The project is currently under development, with core features such as REST APIs for product and category management,
including create, read, update, delete, pagination, and filtering already implemented.
Both category and product APIs support pagination for efficient data retrieval.
The system uses Spring Cloud Gateway with a reactive stack for API routing and service discovery,
enabling scalable microservice communication.

WebClient is used for non-blocking, reactive HTTP calls between services.
Secure user authentication and authorization are implemented using JWT tokens.
